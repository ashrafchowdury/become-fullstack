# Backend Development

I divided my backend into two different stacks, one is with SQL another is with NoSql. I intentionally did it just to explore more and try different techs.

## Tech stacks

### NoSQL

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- NodeJs
- ExpressJs
- JWT
- Stripe
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- helmet
- ...

### SQL

- PostGreSQL
- Prisma
- NodeJs
- ExpressJs
- ....
