# Operating System

An operating system is software that enables applications to interact with a computer's hardware. The software that contains the core components of the operating system is called the `kernel`.

> Architecture: User -> Application Software -> Operating System -> Hardware

## OS Generations

- 0th gen -> [1940]: There was no Operating System available for this generation computer and computer programs were written in machine language.
- 1st gen -> [1951-1956]: The first generation marked the beginning of commercial computing. NO opreting system availble
- 2nd gen -> [1956-1964]: The second generation of computer hardware was most notably characterised by transistors replacing vacuum tubes as th hardware component technology. The first operating system GMOS was developed by the IBM computer.
- 3rd gen -> [1964-1979]: The third generation officially began in April 1964 with IBM’s announcement of its System/360 family of computers.
- 4th gen -> [1979 – Present]: The fourth generation is characterised by the appearance of the personal computer and the workstation. Many Operating Systems which we are using today like Windows, Linux, MacOS etc developed in the fourth generation.
